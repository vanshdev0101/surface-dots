# surface-dots

My personal linux dotfiles, forked from [snes19xx/surface-dots](https://github.com/snes19xx/surface-dots) and tuned to fit my own workflow.
Also, please check out the original author's calendar app: [Evercal](https://github.com/snes19xx/EverCal)

---

## Changes in this fork

Everything below documents the base setup; here's what's different here specifically:

- **Fixed an intermittent password-lockout bug** — a background process was silently retrying a sudo command with no TTY on every bar launch and racking up `pam_faillock` strikes, which occasionally rejected the correct password until reboot. Also fixed the autostart ordering (one unconfigured service was blocking everything launched after it), a Kvantum theme path issue, and the cursor theme not resetting properly.
- **Top-bar mode now has a full Settings panel** (`top-bar/hub/SettingsCard.qml`), matching taskbar mode's — HSL color pickers, Appearance/Power Menu/Weather API/Layout & Bar/Screen Borders/Profile as sectioned cards. Previously top-bar mode only had plain hex fields. Layout & Bar swaps the dock/workspace toggles for a bar-height slider (drives `WlrLayershell.exclusiveZone` directly) and a `→ Task-bar layout` switch button.
- **Remapped keybinds** to match muscle memory from my previous setup — see the updated [Keybindings](#hyprland) section below.
- **Fixed rofi/OSD/power-menu popup animations** — the example configs use `layerrule = {"animation slide, rofi"}`, which is pre-0.55 syntax and is silently a no-op on newer Hyprland. Switched to `hl.layer_rule({ match = {...}, animation = "slide" })` and repositioned the popups to anchor bottom-left instead of center.
- **Added an audio output switcher** (`rofi/audio-output.sh`, bound to `SUPER + SHIFT + A`) to flip between speakers/bluetooth output.
- **Fixed the layout-switch buttons spawning duplicate bar instances** — `qs` is a symlink to `quickshell`, and Linux reports a different process name depending on which one you invoke it by, so the old `pkill qs` in the switch button never matched instances launched via `quickshell -c ...` (or vice versa). Both switch buttons now invoke and kill consistently through `qs -c <name>`.
- Smoothed out window-move and workspace-switch animations, and CPU/GPU/fan monitoring in the bar.

> [!CAUTION]
> Some layout geometry is hardcoded for 3:2 high-resolution display. Deviation in aspect ratio or pixel density will result in misalignment or things looking too big or small. Please follow instructions in the FAQs below to reconfigure values accordingl or start an issue if you require further assistance.

## Installation

A GUI installer is included for installing surface-dots. Full instructions are in [installation.md](.source_codes/installer_src/installation.md) and if you want to learn more about how the installer was written check [installer_readme.md](.source_codes/installer_src/installer_readme.md), sources are in [`.source_codes/installer_src`](./.source_codes/installer_src).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snes19xx/surface-dots
cd surface-dots
chmod +x surface-dots-installer
./surface-dots-installer
```

> [!NOTE]
> The installer does **not** install dependencies, install those yourself first. It's only been tested on Arch. You also need a polkit agent running before you launch it. If it won't start you probably need the WebKitGTK runtime libs, see installation.md for the workaround.
>
> You can always just clone the repo and copy the files around manually if you'd rather not use it.

## Hyprland

<details>
  <summary><strong>Keybindings</strong></summary>

> [!NOTE]
> These reflect this fork's `hyprland.lua`, remapped from upstream to match muscle memory from my previous setup — if you're coming from the base repo, several of these moved (e.g. terminal is now `SUPER + Return`, not `SUPER + Q`).

### Apps

- `SUPER + Return` → terminal (`kitty`)
- `SUPER + E` → file manager (`dolphin`)
- `SUPER + SPACE` → rofi app launcher (top-bar mode)
- `SUPER + B` → firefox
- `SUPER + T` → music player (`tauon`)
- `SUPER + V` → clipboard manager
- `SUPER + C` → shader picker (all 16)
- `SUPER + P` → color picker (`hyprpicker`)
- `CTRL + SHIFT + Escape` → task manager (`btop`)

### Hub / Settings

- `SUPER + A` → toggle hub on or off
- `SUPER + Z` → jump straight to Settings in the hub
- `SUPER + SHIFT + A` → switch audio output (speakers/bluetooth)

### Window actions

- `SUPER + CTRL + Left/Right` → previous/next workspace

### Exit

- `ALT + F4` → Power menu
- `SUPER + ALT + F4` → exit Hyprland
- `SUPER + L` → lock screen

### Focus (arrow keys)

- `SUPER + Left/Right` → move focus horizontally
- `SUPER + UP/Down` → move focus vertically
- `SUPER + SHIFT + arrows` → move the active window in that direction
- `ALT + Tab` → cycle through open windows

### Workspaces

- `SUPER + 1..0` → workspace `1..10`
- `SUPER + SHIFT + 1..0` → move active window to workspace `1..10`
- `SUPER + mouse wheel` → next/prev workspace

### Scratchpad (“special workspace”)

- `SUPER + H` → toggle special workspace `magic`
- `SUPER + SHIFT + S` → move active window to `special:magic`
- `SUPER + S` → move active window to the currently focused workspace

### Mouse (window move/resize)

- `SUPER + LMB` → move window
- `SUPER + RMB` → resize window

### Screenshots

- `Print` → Screen snip
- `SUPER + Print` <i>or</i> `SUPER + O` → Capture screen

## Shaders

Shaders are integral part of my setup, I find them fun.

- All shaders are located at `~/.config/hypr/shaders/`
- shaders can be accessed and toggled through rofi start menu (only in taskbar mode)

OR:

```bash
# activate with:
hyprctl eval 'hl.config({ decoration = { screen_shader = "/<path to shader.glsl>" } })'

# To turn off the screen shader, set the screen_shader value to an empty string.
hyprctl eval 'hl.config({ decoration = { screen_shader = "" } })'

```

#### Reading Mode

A shader-based reading mode to mimic an e-ink reader.

- Toggle with `SUPER + D` or `~/.config/hypr/shaders/reading_mode.sh`
- Automatically disables animations, shadows, and blur
- Custom GLSL shader with e-ink-like color reproduction
- Warm cream paper tone and soft charcoal blacks for reduced contrast
- Fine paper grain -like texture

#### Other shaders

1. **`main.glsl`** – _main shader to improve my display (activates on startup through hyprland exec)_
2. **`night.glsl`** – _my main night-light mode shader_ (toggle with `SUPER + N`)
3. **`outdoor.gls`** – _for maximum outdoor useability_
4. **`cinema.glsl`** – _for media consumption_
5. **`amano.glsl`** – _simulates Yoshitaka Amano artstyle_
6. **`art_canvas.glsl`** – _smulates physical canvas geometry and pigment density_
7. **`dither.glsl`** – _Simulates 4-bit graphics._
8. **`fuji_acros.glsl`** – _simulates fujifilm acros_
9. **`crt_mode.glsl`** – _simulates a crt monitor_
10. **`vhs.glsl`** – _simulates vhs_
11. **`gameboy.glsl`** – _simulates a gameboy screen_
12. **`smart_invert.glsl`** – _eConverts RGB to HSL, inverts the Lightness channel, and converts back_
13. **`silent_hill.glsl`** – _Pacific Northwest / Silent Hill Shader_
14. **`greens.glsl`** – _Retains only green hues and desaturates all other colors to grayscale._

## Desktop Layouts

Two desktop layouts are available depending on how you want the bar positioned.

Use the **top bar layout**:

```bash
qs -c top-bar
```

Use the **taskbar layout**:

```bash
qs -c task-bar
```

Both layouts (mostly) reuse the same core components but behave differently depending on mode.

#### Taskbar Mode Behavior

Taskbar mode has additional desktop components and layout changes:

- `desktop/ScreenBorders.qml`
- `dock/Drawer.qml`

##### Default state (no active windows)

When the session starts or when no windows are open:

- ScreenBorders wrap around the display edges.
- The taskbar switches to dock mode.
- The center of the dock contains a quickshell app drawer: `dock/Drawer.qml`

##### When a window becomes active

As soon as a window opens:

- ScreenBorders hide
- The taskbar switches to workspace mode
  - The taskbar in this state behaves similarly to the regular bar used in top-bar mode, except it appears at the bottom of the screen.
  - The launcher switches from the dock's app drawer (`dock/Drawer.qml`) to the workspace app drawer (`dock/WideDrawer.qml`). This is a custom quickshell app + shader launcher that replaces my rofi setup, toggled with `SUPER + R`.

##### Other taskbar-specific changes

- The appdrawer menu is wider and contains `shaders`
- The Hub media card derives its background colors from album art palette colors, instead of using blurred album artwork.
- Upcoming events are no longer displayed inside `CalendarsWeatherCard.qml` and have a dedicated card
  `hub/Events.qml`. By default, the next upcoming event is shown until it ends. Multiple events can be added to the list by increasing the loop count in the file.
- <strong>Theme switching</strong> also differs between layouts:
  - <u>Taskbar mode</u>: the Hub header has a theme toggle button (dark/light).
  - <u>Topbar mode</u>: right-clicking the Arch glyph launcher icon toggles the theme.
    Both modes use the same theme script just located at:

  ```bash
  # in top bar mode:
  bash ~/config/quickshell/top-bar/bar/theme-mode.sh dark|light
  ```

  ```bash
  # in task bar mode:
  bash ~/config/quickshell/task-bar/utils/theme-mode.sh dark|light
  ```

- Changing colors is generally easier in **Taskbar mode**, as most styling is handled through the dynamic theme system in `lib/ThemeEngine.qml`. Some components still use the older `theme.js` configuration, and a few define their own colors internally, so theme behavior is still not completely unified.

<details>
  
  <summary><strong><u>Expand for Topbar/Taskbar components</u></strong></summary>

### Workspaces

Clicking a workspace pill runs:

```
hyprctl dispatch workspace <id>
```

### Updates

Updates are hardcoded for `archlinux` if you are using a different distro please replace:

```qml
// replace this snippet
sh(`
            if [ -e /var/lib/pacman/db.lck ]; then
                cat /tmp/qs_updates_count 2>/dev/null || echo 0
                exit 0
            fi
            n=$(checkupdates 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
            echo "$n" | tee /tmp/qs_updates_count
        `)
```

with a poller for your distro, for example `debian`:

```qml
// replacement snippet:
sh(`
            # apt list --upgradable does not lock the database, so we skip the lock check
            n=$(apt list --upgradable 2>/dev/null | grep -v 'Listing...' | wc -l)
            echo "$n" | tee /tmp/qs_updates_count
        `)
```

Clicking the updates pill runs:

```bash
kitty -e bash -lc "sudo pacman -Syu"
```

with this line in `Taskbar.qml` (_line 932_) and `Bar.qml`(_line 595_):

```qml
command: ["kitty", "-e", "bash", "-lc", "sudo pacman -Syu"]
```

please replace this line with your package manager's update/upgrade command

### Date and Clock

- Pressing the clock emits a `requestHubToggle()` signal used to open or close the hub.
- Pressing **Esc** or clicking outside the hub closes it.

</details>

# Quickshell Hub

The hub is named 'snes-hub` with

```qml
// in HubWindow.qml (line 78 in task-bar and line 68 in top-bar):
WlrLayershell.namespace: "snes-hub"
```

This is the main control/notification center.
The hub is opened by:

- Clicking the **date/clock module** in the bar
- Pressing **SUPER + SPACE** through a Hyprland keybinding

It is rendered as a **wlr-layershell overlay** designed to stay out of the way and close quickly. The UI is composed of reusable components so cards can be added, removed, or restyled without rewriting the entire hub.

If you want a lightweight fallback, an earlier **AGS** version is available in `.config/ags/`.

<details>
  <summary><strong><u>EXPAND FOR INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS</u></strong></summary>

### Header

- Profile icon and username
- RAM and CPU usage indicators (only in topbar mode)
- Screenshot button (runs capture script and closes the hub)
- Power button
- Theme toggle button (taskbar mode)
- Settings button (taskbar mode)

---

### Settings Panel

There's finally a settings panel so you don't have to edit files for everything.

- **Taskbar mode** (`hub/SettingsPanel.qml`): click the settings button in the Hub header, or press `s` while the hub is focused.
- **Top-bar mode** (`top-bar/hub/SettingsCard.qml`): press `SUPER + Z` to jump straight to it (opens the hub if it isn't already open).

It swaps the hub content in place and lets you change:

- Appearance (theme + accent/colors)
- Weather API location
- Power menu skin (Living Things or Cassini) and its accent
- Layout & bar/taskbar tweaks (taskbar mode: dock/workspace mode + exclusive zone; top-bar mode: bar-height slider, plus a button to switch layouts)
- Screen borders
- Profile picture & events (taskbar mode also shows an Events stepper)

Not everything is wired through it yet, some styling still is in `lib/ThemeEngine.qml` and `theme.js`, but it covers most of the common stuff now.

---

### Wallpaper Panel

`hub/WallpaperPanel.qml` is a wallpaper picker opened from the settings panel. It's backed by a small rust helper (`bin/papel`, source in `.source_codes/wallpaper_panel/`) that generates thumbnails and streams them into the grid over a socket.

- Live thumbnail grid of your wallpaper folder
- Refresh button re-scans the folder for newly added wallpapers
- Pulls a color palette from the selected wallpaper, click a swatch to copy the hex

---

### Power Options

A compact power grid expands **inside the header**.

Open it by:

- Clicking the power button
- Pressing the `p` key

Keyboard navigation:

- Arrow keys / Tab to move
- Enter to activate
- Esc to close

---

### Buttons and Sliders

- `Wi-Fi toggle` with SSID readout (right-click opens the Wi-Fi module)
- `Bluetooth toggle` with connected device status
- `Performance profile button` (cycles profiles through `auto-cpufreq`, right click toggles battery health card)
- `DND toggle` (dunst)
- `Volume and brightness sliders` (`pactl` and `brightnessctl`)

---

### Battery Health

The battery health card shows RAM and CPU usage in Taskbar mode.

Polled using:

```
upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT1
```

Displayed information:

- Health (capacity %)
- Current charge %
- Charge cycles
- Energy (full / design)
- Time remaining (when available)
- Charging state

> NOTE  
> If your battery device is not `battery_BAT1`, update the device path in `BatteryHealthCard.qml`.

---

### Media Card (MPRIS)

The hub includes an **MPRIS media card**.

- Appears only when media is playing
- Clicking it launches the external **Now Playing widget** and closes the hub
- Resets its internal state when track metadata changes

Some browser content (like YouTube) can behave inconsistently depending on how the browser exposes MPRIS.

In taskbar mode, the media card uses colors extracted from album art instead of blurred artwork backgrounds.

---

### Now Playing (Flutter)

This is a separate Flutter desktop widget managed through Hyprland window rules.

Behavior:

- Window resizing is disabled (`setResizable(false)`)
- Esc closes the widget
- Theme colors are generated from album artwork using `palette_generator`

> NOTE  
> You may need to make the now_playing binary executable and change the path to it in MediaCard.qml

---

### Calendar, Weather and Events

The hub includes a calendar and weather card using a JSON-based weather script.

Calendar events are synced from **Google Calendar** using:

- `vdirsyncer`
- `khal`

Events are displayed in a dedicated Events card in Taskbar mode instead of inside `CalendarsWeatherCard.qml`.

The next upcoming event remains visible until it finishes. Multiple events can be configured inside:

```
hub/Events.qml
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Google Calendar sync (vdirsyncer + khal)</strong></summary>

Recommended installation method (avoids system Python packaging issues):

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed python-pipx
```

```bash
pipx install "vdirsyncer[google]"
```

If both a system and pipx version of vdirsyncer exist, remove the system package and ensure `~/.local/bin` appears earlier in `PATH`.

### Setup

Create the required directories:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/vdirsyncer/status ~/.config/vdirsyncer/tokens
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/vdirsyncer/calendars
```

Example configuration values:

```
token_file = "~/.config/vdirsyncer/tokens/google_calendar"
type = "google_calendar"
client_id / client_secret
```

Calendar files are stored in:

```
~/.local/share/vdirsyncer/calendars/*
```

Khal reads `.ics` files from this location.

### Notes

- The **CalDAV API** must be enabled in Google Cloud.
- If OAuth consent is in testing mode, add yourself as a **test user**.
- If you receive “token obtained but Not Found”, enable calendars at:

https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect

### Sync and test

```bash
vdirsyncer discover
vdirsyncer sync
khal list now 7d
```

</details>

---

### Notifications

- Clicking a notification dismisses it
- Uses dunst (`dunstctl`) as the backend
- Collapsed by default when the media card is active
- Can be expanded with the expand button

---

</details>

## Power menu

<p align="center">

  <img src="media/screenshots/cassini_light.png" height="220" alt="Cassini Light">
  <img src="media/screenshots/powermenu.png" height="220" alt="Power Menu Dark">
</p>

wlr-layershell power menu overlay (separate from the hub header menu). Toggled with ALT+F4

It comes in two skins (pick one in the settings panel):

- **Living Things** — the original everforest power menu
- **Cassini** — an editorial black & white look with a random Cassini photograph on the side

Both share the same logic (`utils/PowerMenuController.qml`), the skins are just presentation.

**Run**

```bash
# in Topbar mode:
quickshell -p ~/.config/quickshell/top-bar/bar/PowerMenu.qml
```

```bash
# in Taskbar mode:
quickshell -p ~/.config/quickshell/task-bar/utils/PowerMenu.qml
```

## Wifi menu

Standalone network manager applet located at lib/WifiMenu.qml. With both (light/dark) theme.

- Trigger: Right-click the Wi-Fi button in the Hub.
- or run: `quickshell -p ~/<pathto>lib/Wifimenu.qml`

> [!WARNING]
> You should be able to connect to most enterprise access points now (PEAP/MSCHAPv2 only). That covers most corporate/campus networks (including eduroam), but if you ever hit an enterprise AP that requires EAP-TLS (client certificates) or EAP-TTLS, this menu won't handle it -- you'd need nmcli/nmtui directly for that.

## OSDs

Custom on-screen displays for:

- Volume
- Brightness
- Various system modes (Dark, Light, Reading Mode, etc.)

## Firefox Customizations

#### Codex Stellarium <img src="media/screenshots/cs_icon.png" width="48" alt="" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 6px;" />

<div align="left">
  <img src="media/screenshots/cs.jpg" width="700" alt="Codex Stellarium preview on Firefox" />
</div>

##### Get it on Firefox [![Get Codex Stellarium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-Add--on-orange?logo=firefox&logoColor=white)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codex-stellarium/)

_Codex Stellarium_ is an interactive, customizeable astronomy inspired custom new tab/homepage. Replaces the default new tab with an interactive starfield, planetary system, and comet simulator. Contains:

- **Canvas Animations:** Interactive comets, planetary orbits, and a parallax starfield.
- **Dynamic Theme:** Auto-switches between light and dark modes based on local time or weather conditions.
- **Live Data:** Displays current weather (via Open-Meteo API), lunar phase, and sidereal time.
- **Shortcuts:** Configurable quick links.

##### Manual Installation

> [!NOTE]
>
> - I have a `.crx` file in the codex-stellarium directory if you want to use it in a chromium-based browser. <br>
> - I also have other custom home/newtab pages in `.config/firefox/custom_homes` that can be installed with this method

`.config/firefox/codex-stellarium`
Firefox doesn't really want you to use local html as a new tab page, if you want to isntall codex stellarium manually or use your own html as custom new tab:

- Move `config/firefox/defaults/pref/autoconfig.js` to Firefox defaults/pref/ (e.g. /usr/lib/firefox/defaults/pref/)
- Edit `config/firefox/mozilla.cfg` (repo path: `.config/firefox/mozilla.cfg`) and set your file path
- Move `mozilla.cfg` to the Firefox install directory root (e.g. /usr/lib/firefox/)

#### userChrome

`/chrome/userChrome.css`: A custom stylesheet that overrides the default Firefox interface. (These customizations work in windows or other os as well)

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand for instructions to install custom usercss:</strong></summary>

##### 1. Enable Stylesheets in Firefox

1. Open Firefox and enter `about:config` in the URL bar.
2. Accept the risk warning.
3. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`.
4. Double-click to set the value to `true`.

##### 2. Locate Your Active Profile

1. Go to `about:profiles`.
2. Find the profile box that states: <i>"This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted."</i>
3. Copy the path listed under **Root Directory**  
   (e.g., `/home/username/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default-release`).

##### 3. Install the Files

- Copy the `userChrome.css` into the `chrome` folder  
  (create it if it doesn't exist, or move the `chrome` folder from this repo)

</details>

## Cursors

<p align="left">
  <img src="media/Saturnian-Day-progress.gif" height="64">
  <img src="media/Saturnian-Day-wait.gif" height="64">
</p>

##### `Saturnian` cursor theme:

Custom cursor theme for Surface-dots in two variants - `Saturnian-Night` for dark desktops `Saturnian-Day` for light.
For more info:Read [cursor_readme.md](cursor/README.md)

**Note** The installer does not install cursor. Please install it manually; follow the steps below:

###### Install

```sh
./install.sh              # current user  -> ~/.local/share/icons
sudo ./install.sh --system  # all users   -> /usr/share/icons
./install.sh --uninstall
```

Then, without restarting anything:

```sh
hyprctl setcursor Saturnian-Night 32
```

## Themes

##### GTK:

I use a modified version of Fausto-Korpsvart's Everforest gtk theme. The installer automatically copies it to the required directory for the theme toggle script to use it.

##### Qt / Kvantum

Kvantum theme files are located in:
`.config/Kvantum`

Additional related configuration files:

- `.config/qt6ct  `
- `.config/color-schemes`

Use _Kvantum Manager_ to install and apply the Kvantum theme.

## Lockscreens

### SDDM

<div align="center">
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; gap:10px;">
  <img src="media/screenshots/sddm_stellarium.jpg" width="400" />
  <img src="media/screenshots/sddm_pixel.jpg" width="400" />
</div>
</div>

I have two SDDM themes:

- Stellarium SDDM theme (Astronomy inspired)
- Pixel SDDM theme (Android inspired)

The installer installs the themes and writes to conf.d automatically based on your choice. It will however prompt you for password authorization via pkexec.

- For Manual install:
  - move the contents of sddm/theme folder to `/usr/share/sddm/themes/` (create the dir if it doesn't exist yet) and:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/sddm.conf.d
    echo -e "[Theme]\nCurrent=stellarium" | sudo tee /etc/sddm.conf.d/theme.conf
    ```

### Hyprlock

I have two hyprlock themes that are designed to look exactly like the SDDM themes above:

<div align="center">
    <img src="media/screenshots/hyprlock.png" height=350 alt="screenshot" />
</div>

- Stellarium hyprlock theme (Astronomy inspired)
- Pixel hyprlock theme (Android inspired)

## Utilities

Utilities include the following:

- `crt_gen.py` a script to add crt like filters to an image (works best with images that aren't too bright or too dark)
- `figures.py` script to generate nice fun mathematical illustrations
- `SR4.icm` Color profile for the display of the Surface Laptop 4. Import it in KDE Plasma to get Windows-like color calibration.
- Fonts I like and use often

## FAQs

**Q: Will this run on a distro other than Arch Linux?** <br>
_A: I'm not sure about the installer but as long as you have the dependencies I don't see why it wouldn't._

**Q: Can I use this setup with another compositor or desktop environment?** <br>
_A: Yes. Most features, including Quickshell, will work correctly (as long as you're on wayland). Shaders are the only exception. However, some features exclusively rely on hyprland's ipcs, for best experience please use with hyprland_

**Q: Why use Flutter for the "Now Playing" widget?** <br>
_A: It was one of my first projects while learning Flutter, which explains the older dependencies. Behind the Material Design frontend, it is just a standard MPRIS controller._

**Q: How does the face unlock animation work?** <br>
_A: It assumes the authentication was successful by default. You may need to adjust the timer in `main.qml` to get the timing right for a realistic effect. It does properly recognize authentication failures and timeouts._

**Q: Why are there multiple app drawers (including the top-bar Rofi drawers)?**<br>
\_A: I am currently experimenting with different designs and layouts. Taskbar mode now has a custom quickshell app + shader drawer (`dock/WideDrawer.qml`) that replaces rofi, moving forward I will only update this.

**Q: Why are the desktop layouts two different shells instead of one unified shell with two options?**<br>
_A: The project originally started as a simple calendar widget for my Google Calendar events. As more components were added over time, it evolved without a strict overall layout plan. Consolidating everything into a single shell would require significant code edits which I don't want to do atm_

**Q: How do I enable or disable screen borders?** <br>
_A: (Only in taskbar mode) follow the instruction in shell.qml_

**Q: Components are misaligned in the hub. How do I fix them?** <br>
_A: You can correct alignment by adding padding (left, right, up, down), adjusting spacing, or using the `translate` function. For example, to move weather in `CalendarWeather` card to the right:_

```qml
// Right: Weather
      ColumnLayout {
        Layout.alignment: Qt.AlignTop | Qt.AlignRight
        Layout.preferredWidth: 110

        /* increase to move right, decrease (values can be negatives too) to move to the left */
        transform: Translate { x: 5 }  // <--- add this
```

**Q: The taskbar is covering windows at the bottom of the screen. How do I fix this?** <br>
_A: Decrease the layer exclusive zone in `Taskbar.qml` or increase the gaps in Hyprland config._

```qml
// desktop/Taskbar.qml
    WlrLayershell.exclusiveZone: 47 // <-- change this
```

**Q: Can I use the top-bar Rofi on the taskbar, or vice versa?** <br>
_A: Yes. You just need to edit the path to the launcher script in your Hyprland configuration and update the on-click action within the launcher component for the respective bars._

**Q: The theme switcher is not applying my GTK or Qt themes. How do I fix it?** <br>
_A: First, make sure the script has executable permissions. Next, verify the theme files exist and match the names referenced in the script. Finally, run the script directly from the terminal to check for specific error messages abd fix them one by one._

**Q: The wallpaper panel is empty or won't apply anything. How do I fix it?** <br>
_A: By default it reads from `~/Pictures/Wallpapers`, set `PAPEL_DIR` if yours live somewhere else. It also needs `awww` running to actually set the wallpaper, and `bin/papel` has to be executable. If you just added new wallpapers, hit the refresh button so it re-scans the folder._

**Q: How do I switch the power menu skin?** <br>
_A: Open the settings panel (either layout — `s` in taskbar mode, `SUPER + Z` in top-bar mode) and go to the power menu section, you can pick between Living Things and Cassini there, and set a custom accent for each one._

**Q: The weather is wrong or not showing up. How do I fix it?** <br>
_A: Set your location in the weather section of the settings panel, or edit `lib/weather.sh` directly. It pulls from the Open-Meteo API so you need `curl` and `jq` installed and a working connection._

**Q: I changed something in the settings panel but it didn't stick. Why?** <br>
_A: Most settings are saved through `lib/Configuration.qml`, so make sure it can actually write to its config location. A few components still read their colors from `theme.js` or define them internally, so those bits still need a manual file edit for now._

**Q: How do I add my own shader to the wide app drawer?** <br>
_A: Drop the `.glsl` in `~/.config/hypr/shaders/`, then add a matching icon in `dock/shader-icons/` (and a light-mode version in `dock/shader-icons/light/`) so it shows up in the drawer's shader tab._
